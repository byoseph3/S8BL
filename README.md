# S8BL
Welcome! This is a small passion project I call "S8BL" (pronounced like "Mabel", but with an S).

S8BL, Sample 8-Bit Lua, is my first attempt at writing an 8-bit Operating System in Lua. Currently, S8BL is written in LuaU in order for it to run on the Roblox platform. This will be changed in the future to run within a Linux environment.

S8BL allows you to run its own shellcode, or use the compiler to write the shellcode in a language similar to Assembly.

## Instructions
Since S8BL only works in Roblox Studio at the moment, copy and paste the scripts found in the "modules" directory into their own module scripts. Then require either the compiler or both.

Both LocalScripts and Scripts work when running S8BL

## Changes
### v1
August 14th, 2022

S8BL is now released open source as a LuaU project.
